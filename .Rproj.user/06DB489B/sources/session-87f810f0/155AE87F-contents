title: "About Me"
---

My name is James Forster III and I am a 4th year PhD student in the Kulkarni Immunoengineering Lab at UMass! My research focuses on the adaptation of mRNA and combination nanotherapeutics targeted to modulate the innate immune system and treat chronic inflammatory disease and cancer. This work has resulted in 5 publications so far, the first of which I will introduce in the section "My first manuscript" below. Outside of lab, I enjoy spending time with friends and family, cooking, and most importantly, playing guitar and listening to rock, metal, and jazz music.
